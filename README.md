## React Bottom Room

React Bottom Room is a dynamic and user-friendly React component designed to manage the visibility of a bottom navigation bar in your web applications. Inspired by the react-headroom package, react-bottom-room enhances the user experience by automatically hiding the bottom navigation bar when scrolling down and revealing it when scrolling up. This maximizes screen real estate without sacrificing easy navigation access.

## Key Features

- Dynamic Visibility: The bottom navigation bar automatically hides when scrolling down and shows when scrolling up, providing a clean and immersive user experience.

- Easy to Use: Simply wrap your navigation bar component with react-bottom-room and it handles the rest.

- Customizable: Supports all standard div attributes, allowing you to customize the navigation bar to fit your needs.

- Lightweight: With a small footprint, it doesn’t add unnecessary weight to your project.
